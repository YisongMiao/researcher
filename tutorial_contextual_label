Hi all!

I managed to use these contextual labels with the help of [Dr. Vered Shwartz](https://vered1986.github.io/).

Here is how she told me:

I used the default bootstrap labels: https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_labels2&stacked=h, and added a few of my own to the CSS, for example:

.label-short {
    background-color: #d27979;
}

And then in the HTML:
<span class="label label-short">short</span>


Thanks Vered!
