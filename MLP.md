# MLP Blog

A blog for MLP. MLP stands for **M**odel, **L**anguage and **P**hilosophy, NOT **M**ulti-**L**ayer **P**erceptron (MLP) ðŸ˜›

My name is Yisong. I am a junior Ph.D. student studying Natural Language Processing. 

Most of my current works study limited datasets (annotated by limited human) in a limited form (mostly tensors) by limited models (mostly invented in the last 5 years). 

How do my current works relate to classic math / ML / AI **models** (perhaps invented 20 years ago)?

How do my current works relate to classic **linguistic** theory?

How do my current works implicate **philosophical** views?



I expect an update frequency around once a month.

I have come with the titles for the first few blogs:

**Blog 1:** When a junior NLPer reads Ludwig Wittgenstein.

**Blog 2:** On information bottleneck with my tasks.

**Blog 3:** On systematic generalization with my tasks (starting from F&P 1988).
