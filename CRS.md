- **Taxonomy creation**: Existing feature taxonomies are handcrafted. Is there a smart/soft way to build a taxonomy for better system design and evaluation?
- **Discourse structure:** Existing works (ours included) consider multi-round dialogue in a superficial manner. What features/products in previous rounds **contrast** with those later? What information users heard in previous rounds **caused** their later decision?
- **Real-world applications:** Many works (ours included) are developed and evaluated in the sandbox -- user simulation. How can we develop systems with (and for) real-world users (with diverse backgrounds, multiplex intent, and language variations)?

**Recommendation:** [Tutorials](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hexn/slides/sigir20-tutorial-CRS-slides.pdf) by Wenqiang et al. A pretty cool integrated [CRSLab](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CRSLab) environment by RUC. Talk to my group mate [Victor Li](https://lichuangnus.github.io/) who is currently studying this topic.
