**One-sentence SOP:** I want to build computational models that understand human's language in an explainable and intelligent way. 



## Discourse

Discourse concerns the organization of text in a coherent and logical manner. It is a perfect discipline to study language understanding because diverse linguistic devices exist and complex reasoning is required. 

The problem is decomposed as:

- **Can we find a computational proxy for understanding discourse?** Despite the strong performance, pretrained language models (PLMs) are said to NOT understand the language [from text alone](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.463/). But can we say [certain understanding is achieved](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.143/) when the models [behave like human](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.8/)?
- **Intermediate guidance for better understanding?** PLMs are also prone to adversarial input and spurious features. Can we guide the model with human's intelligence about decision-making [as intermediate input](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14465)?
- **Neurons for discourse functions?** Can we [causally estimate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262) [different components](http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/) in PLMs that are responsible for different discourse functions? 
- **Better pretraining strategy?** Popular PLMs (e.g. BERT) are trained in a [mask] way ([mask]=(simple, stupid, ...)). Are there better pretraining strategies to make it understand the language better?
