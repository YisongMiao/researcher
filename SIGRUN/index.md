## Call for Participation

### Basics

- Duration: May 11th -- May 31st (3 weeks)
- Team of maximum of two. Single person is also accepted. 

- Each person 3 running day in a week, at least 3.5 Km each time.
- You receive your money-back in a weekly basis. (i.e. 100 RMB back at the end of week if you accomplish 3x3.5km, and 0 RMB back if you don't)

### Dice Rolling!

- üé≤ Dice Rolling is back!!! It is one of the favorite activity in past events. Everyday, the person who achieves the longest run is possible to add more distance to another group. 
- The rolling rule is interesting. First, the player claims a number **X** in range (1, 18). Then he roll the dice 3 times. If the sum of 3 rolling is larger than **X**, then he can add 0.2* **X** Kms to another group. For example, Yisong claims X = 16, three time the rolling is [5, 6, 6], which sums to 17. Since 17 > 16, he can add 0.2 * 17 = 3.4 Km to another group. However, if Yisong's rolling is [1, 1, 1], which sums to 3, he has no chance to add distance to other groups. 
- All group members can share the responsibility to finish the added distance (e.g. 3.4 km). 
-  You can use a 4-th or 5-th run to finish the added distance, it is fine that you only run 3.4  which is less than 3.5.

### Bonus and Rankings

- Bonus sharing is still based on the total distance, similar to Xinyi's rule last time, e.g., 7 perple enrolled, the share that 1st guy will receive is: ` 7 / (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 7)`
- However, in order to encourage competitive running, reward will be given to: (1) the person who achives the single longest run; (2) the person who added the longest distance to other group through rolling the dice! For both guys in (1) and (2), his ranking will be promoted by `1`. For example, if Yisong achieves the single longest run and ranks only 3rd, he will be promoted to 2nd. This reward can be used by one person for 2 times (i.e., promoted by 2).
