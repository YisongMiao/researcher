# Max Prob

Work in Progress. Last update: 7th Nov.



## Definition

MaxProb describes the **max** **prob**ability in a distribution.



## Motivation

We will start from two representative paper. 

One for surface competition [PDF@[aclweb](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.564/)], one for domain shift in QA tasks [PDF@[aclweb](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.503/)]. 





## Techniques

- ML community. 
- NLP community.



## Limitation

We all know `max` function has no gradient. 

```latex
max = $argmax$ $\times$ $D$
```



Can we make a differentiable type of MaxProb?
