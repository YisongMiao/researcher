I like this work a lot, because it tells the intrinsic properties of their model and their relation with other important concept. For example:

> We hypothesize that the sequence of discourse role transitions in a coherent text provides clues that distinguish it from an incoherent text. The discourse role matrix thus provides the foundation for com- puting such role transitions, on a per term basis. In fact, each column of the matrix corresponds to a lexical chain (Morris and Hirst, 1991) for a partic- ular term across the whole text. The key differences from the traditional lexical chains are that our chain nodesâ€™ entities are simplified (they share the same stemmed form, instead being connected by WordNet relations), but are further enriched by being typed with discourse relations.
