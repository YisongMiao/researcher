## January

01-18 W:

- Showed my manuscript to Liangming. Received many insightful comments! 

  **Takeaways:**

  - On the position of this manuscript (it's still a bit unlcear, but there's little I can do before ACL deadline). 
  - The idea is cool and valid. 
  - On my long-term tasks. Think about involving more challenging reasoning, creating a new task with more challenging examples. Otherwise it's less space for our "ordinary NLPer" to do in the era of GPT3/ChatGPT. 

- Think about Liangming's feedback. Read the EMNLP '22 paper, I find it's an easy idea with straightforward execution. 

- Try to revise some minor points ...  



01-17 T:

- Paper revision. 
- TA meetings. 



01-16 M:

- Paper revision.



01-15 U:

- Paper revision. 
  - Try to change the discourse structure of the paper. 
  - Abs + Intro 1st interation of the revision.



01-14 S:

- Family day. Went to my Grandma's house. Met my uncle antie and my cousin with my parents. 
- I think my driving skill has upgraded to a new level. I drove all the way smoothly. 



01-13 F:

- Group meeting. Chenglei gave a very nice presentation. I learned a lot from it. 



01-12 R:

- Read papers. 



01-11 W:

- Prepare for meeting w/ Nancy and Wenqiang. 
- Meet Nancy. Receive encouraging feedbacks. 



01-10 T:

- TA meeting for CS4248. 
- Read Yoav's note on LLM: https://gist.github.com/yoavg/59d174608e92e845c8994ac2e234c8a9 



01-09 M:

- Prepare for the meeting w/ Min. 
- Meet Min. 

**Major takeaway from the meeting:**

- Min told me it's better to be explicit (even though reviewers might disagree), than to be ambiguous and confuse the reviewer. 
- I asked Min so how big a dataset shoud be? Min told me the size can be justfied by the usefulness (e.g. improvement on another task). 



01-08 U:

- Prepare for the meeting w/ Min. 

  **Major progress:** Compare my work with two recent papers and think of a new argument. Come up a new paper map for Zi Yun's rejected manuscript.
