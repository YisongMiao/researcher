**Week 10:** 

03-27 U:

- Went to Liangming's Lunch organized by Yajing. 
- Went to Botanic Garden to enjoy Gin and Tonic made by Zejun (takeaway package!). 



03-26 S:

- Submitted my author feedback to ACL-23. 
- Went to Ê≠åË∞£ Geyao 2023 where featured Longshen üéª. It was pretty nice. 
- A playlist for my recording: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNsYEMHIB4shDAL20_Q4VydWyOZ2JID0-](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNsYEMHIB4shDAL20_Q4VydWyOZ2JID0-). Geyao people have nicely agreed this playlist to go public (previously unlisted). 



03-22 \~ 03-25 W to F: Forgot to record on a daily basis ...

- Tried to make ELCo to *SEM but didn't make it ü•≤

- Friday's group meeting: Yiran's talk is closely related to me. Think about how to improve? Arranged a discussion on 31st March. 



03-21 T: 

- Still think about Min's comments. 
- Try out Midjourney (OK ... I spent too much time on it. Need have a hard constraint of the time!)
  - OK ... Even though I wasted some time, I have a few takeaways!
  - Midjourney is very good at generating open ended prompts, like, "**Two PhD students (male, asian) are discussing Midjourney in their lab (CS department).**" Image here: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1087630864789295155/1087969374066970686/yisong_Two_PhD_students_male_asian_are_discussing_Midjourney_in_ca29cd94-3b56-48c7-93e7-e39ce536c974.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1087630864789295155/1087969374066970686/yisong_Two_PhD_students_male_asian_are_discussing_Midjourney_in_ca29cd94-3b56-48c7-93e7-e39ce536c974.png)
  - But it fails at prompts requiring a latent structure, for example:
    - **A young man (black hair) is drawing on his iPad. What he is drawing is a chocolate cake.** The result ends up like a man is eating the cake on top of an iPad with Apple pencil (as his fork).  Image here: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1087630864789295155/1087710774308376687/yisong_A_young_man_black_hair_is_drawing_on_his_iPad._What_he_i_bf7e688f-dc13-4063-985e-377fa68edd65.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1087630864789295155/1087710774308376687/yisong_A_young_man_black_hair_is_drawing_on_his_iPad._What_he_i_bf7e688f-dc13-4063-985e-377fa68edd65.png)
    - **A beautiful girl is drawing a profile photo for her boy friend.** The result ends up like a girl is drawing a picture for another girl. 
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è It's interesting to think about how to incorporate such latent structures into the prompts and inform the model ( ‚≠êÔ∏èMin also told me this is an important problem. )

02-23 R:

- Reflect on the meeting w/ Min. Stratify my research into 3 layers. 



02-22 W:

- ‚≠êÔ∏è Zoom w/ Neo about GPTs and ICL. Potential collaboration w/ OpenAI in the future.
- Video w/ Yahui, for queries about my undergrad institute and discuss her current study of Mooc. 
- Kick off my project mentoring meeting with all 5 teams I am working with (A very tough 4-hour session. I didn't sleep well ...). I like some of the teams' initiatives. Some of them already have their ideas. Some of them come up with their own ideas after a few "prompts" from me. Some of them need more help. 



02-21 T:

- TA meeting. 



02-20 M:

- ‚≠êÔ∏è Met Min. 
- Dinner w/ Qizhe. 



02-19 U:

02-17 F:

- ‚≠êÔ∏è Met Q. 
- Read Q's papers. 



02-16 R:

- Present at George's seminar about ChatGPT. 
- Audiences (most are entrepreneurs) liked my presentation a lot, especially the theory of LMs and how I explained why ChatGPT is stronger than previous LMs. 
- Their burning question: How to specialize ChatGPT for their own business? 
  - My answers: it really depends on how OpenAI plans to opensource ChatGPT. (1) Decoding strategies (if NOT opensourced); (2) Domain-specific fine-tuning (if opensourced). 
- I highlighted the ethical concern and responsible use of ChatGPT. 



02-15 W:

- Reply to students' email/TG messages for my TA class. 
- Prepare for a meeting w/ J. Met J and discuss about my research. 
- Prepare for my presentation tomorrow. 



02-14 T:

- J's visit. Seminar, lunch and PhD meetings. 



02-13 M:

- Read papers. 



02-11 S:

- Meetup w/ Qian and Longxu in Botanic Gardens. Recieved a lot of useful feedback!



02-10 F:

- Present and pilot my annotation task in group. 



02-09 R:

- Prepare for my annotation task. 



02-08 W:

- TG05/06.
  - It is the first time Min sits in my tutorial. I felt a bit nervous. But it completed OK. 
  - Min gave me feedback for my teaching skill (I need to save them if I want to be Prof later ...)
- Preparation for my annotation task in group meeting. 
  - Design done. (Slides skeleton, annotation workflow). 
  - Not clear about the definition of `simulatability`. It is to simulate the ground truth answer, or to simulate model's prediction (which is not necessarily true)?
- Continue reading thesis. 



02-07 T:

- TA meeting and TG02. 
- Read papers by Dan Iter and Karthik Narasimhan. 



02-06 M:

- Meet Min w/ Longxu, Tongyao, and HC.
- I received a ton of feedback (an intense discussion! don't know how Min managed that everyday).
- Summarized the meeting in QA style. Check `Meeting 6 Feb 2023` in my personal notion. 



02-05 U:

Prepare for tomorrow's meeting w/ Min:

- Read my 1-man slack's message about all ideas / problems I recorded for discourse. 
- Chat w/ HC. 
- Slides done. Come up one core question to ask Min tomorrow with evidence supporting that. 



02-03 F:

- Attend Longxu's meeting. 



02-02 R:

- Read papers esp by Qian.
- Longxu and Qian invite me to collaborate on my research!



02-01 W:

- Thinking about a fine-grained experiment section for ELCo. 50% done. I find Qing's paper @ NAACL'22 a very good example from meta-level. 
- Study Chuyuan's paper, the idea of attention is interesting. 
- Reply to students' email. 



## January

01-31 T:

- TA meeting (I find the traffic is much faster in early morning). 
- Give T01-T04.
- Help Tutu's submission a bit. 



01-30 M:

- Prepare for the tutorial.
- Read a few *SEM papers. 



01-18 W:

- Showed my manuscript to Liangming. Received many insightful comments! 

  **Takeaways:**

  - On the position of this manuscript (it's still a bit unlcear, but there's little I can do before ACL deadline). 
  - The idea is cool and valid. 
  - On my long-term tasks. Think about involving more challenging reasoning, creating a new task with more challenging examples. Otherwise it's less space for our "ordinary NLPer" to do in the era of GPT3/ChatGPT. 

- Think about Liangming's feedback. Read the EMNLP '22 paper, I find it's an easy idea with straightforward execution. 

- Try to revise some minor points ...  



01-17 T:

- Paper revision. 
- TA meetings. 



01-16 M:

- Paper revision.



01-15 U:

- Paper revision. 
  - Try to change the discourse structure of the paper. 
  - Abs + Intro 1st interation of the revision.



01-14 S:

- Family day. Went to my Grandma's house. Met my uncle antie and my cousin with my parents. 
- I think my driving skill has upgraded to a new level. I drove all the way smoothly. 



01-13 F:

- Group meeting. Chenglei gave a very nice presentation. I learned a lot from it. 



01-12 R:

- Read papers. 



01-11 W:

- Prepare for meeting w/ Nancy and Wenqiang. 
- Meet Nancy. Receive encouraging feedbacks. 



01-10 T:

- TA meeting for CS4248. 
- Read Yoav's note on LLM: https://gist.github.com/yoavg/59d174608e92e845c8994ac2e234c8a9 



01-09 M:

- Prepare for the meeting w/ Min. 
- Meet Min. 

**Major takeaway from the meeting:**

- Min told me it's better to be explicit (even though reviewers might disagree), than to be ambiguous and confuse the reviewer. 
- I asked Min so how big a dataset shoud be? Min told me the size can be justfied by the usefulness (e.g. improvement on another task). 



01-08 U:

- Prepare for the meeting w/ Min. 

  **Major progress:** Compare my work with two recent papers and think of a new argument. Come up a new paper map for Zi Yun's rejected manuscript.
