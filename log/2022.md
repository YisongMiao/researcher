11-01 T:

- Read papers (discourse / machine learning / Min's 1998 verb paper)
- 2 hour discussion with Jielin. She consulted me training for a vision model. I take analogy from different levels in NLP and advise her to try to stratify her problem. 
- Basketball 500kCal. 



10-31 M:

- Finish discussion period for AAAI-23 review. 
- Update my webpage and initialize 2022 log starting today (many of them are offline, too lazy to move online).
