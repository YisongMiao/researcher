## November

11-06 U:

\<ELCo>

- Meet Zi Yun, get her dataset. 
- I think harder about the problem formalization. Read Vered's and Chris' paper and find they both perform classifications.
- I realized in our existing setting, the assumptions for ranking and classification are equivalent. 



11-04 F:

\<Group meeting>

- With a nice coincidence, I introduced Zixu to our group in the social session as he wanted to learn sequential modeling from us.
- \<Didn't do much on my own research>, need to push up tomorrow. 



11-03 R:

- Continue reading Liangming's references about information gain and try to make sense from them. 
- Sit in Xiachong and Taha's meeting and know what they are doing (and the state-of-the-art in their field).



11-02 W:

- Attend Yuxi's meeting w/ Min.
- Talked w/ Liangming. He is interested in my next work. He offers two points: (1) My ongoing topic is very promising w.r.t. his view. (2) A max info gain perspective ... leads to the next point👇 
- Read the papers from Goodman's group and William's group but haven't really understood. 



11-01 T:

- Read papers (discourse / machine learning / Min's 1998 verb paper)
- 2 hour research discussion with Jielin. She consulted me the training for a vision model for designers. I take analogy from different levels in NLP and advise her to try to stratify her problem. 
- Basketball 500kCal. 



## October

10-31 M:

- Finish discussion period for AAAI-23 review. 
- Update my webpage and initialize 2022 log starting today (many of them are offline, too lazy to move online).
