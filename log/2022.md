## December



12-19 M:

- Study what model can take a set of premise as input. 
  - The answer is no. We have to customize. 



12-16 F:

- Presentation at group meeting. 



12-15 R:

- Slides. 



12-14 W:

- Problem formalization like FST.



12-12 M:

- Study how other language games work. ([Daily games](https://preply.com/en/blog/at-home-language-learning-games/) / [Philosophical games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)))
- Read the paper Xiachong recommended to me. 
- Corpus study: 
  - I find multi-hop reasoning is NOT that desired. 
  - I also find QGen in my existing work needs a lot of improvement. 
- Think about abductive reasoning. 



12-11 S:

- Receive meta-review.
  - The opinion/score is not too bad, but we still have doubts that haven't been clarified. 😞



12-09 F:

- Still thinking about Smarter. 
- ⭐️ Tried ChatGPT on my task. 
  - Pretty impressive! Plenty of useful evidence can be extracted to facilitate its reasoning. 
  - Weakness is logic (e.g. negation). Still cannot make correct prediction when I inform its "belief" on a fact (by negating it). 
    - Yuxi said NN is still trained on a statistical manner. Not logic. I said Honghua Zhang's paper about the paradox explained it. 
  - Some ideas in our next work is endorsed. By trying and interacting ... 
  - I think ChatGPT provides a new interface to interact with the model, by updating its belief/opinion with natural language. 



12-08 R:

- Think about Smarter. Write down a few hypotheses to be testes. 



12-05\~12-07 M\~W:

- Family time



12-03 U:

- Read Finale Doshi-Velez's papers as Level 2-3 reading. Min said she is going to teach CS6216 next Sem. 



12-02 F:

- Group meeting. 



12-01 R:

- Pick up Xin at the Airport.



## November

11.30:

- Read papers. EMNLP '22 paper recommended by Min. Flan-T5 paper recommended by Xiachong.



11.21 - 11.29:

In the past 1 week 

- Quarentine @ Hotel.
- Quatentine @ Home.
- Drafted the rebuttal together with Min. 
- Upload my GAP hours claim. 



11-16\~11-19 W~S:

Flight, arrival and start of quarentine. 



11-15 T:

CS5228 A3. 



11-14 M:

Return the books to the library. 



11-11 F:

- PCR 🧪
- Thinking about language game. 



11-10 R:

\<Take a rest>

- Help Saurabh edit his SOP.
- CS5228 TA slides for assignments 2. 



11-09 W:

- Prepare for the research meeting w/ Min.

- Meet Min. Advice received: we have missed level 0 reading about Emoji. I cannot decide it is a dataset/model/linguistic theory paper before I know the knowledge. It is better to have a depth first search than breadth first search in a conference paper. Reviewers need to decide which type of the paper it is before accept it. 

  Besides, Min also thinks information gain is a good idea. 



11-08 T:

- Corpus study for ELCo. 
- Busy figuring out my PCR tests 🧪.



11-07 M:

\<ELCo> and \<Smarter>

- Still try to formalize ELCo. 
- Talk about the \<Smarter> project with Hongfu. 



11-06 U:

\<ELCo>

- Meet Zi Yun, get her dataset. 
- I think harder about the problem formalization. Read Vered's and Chris' paper and find they both perform classifications.
- I realized in our existing setting, the assumptions for ranking and classification are equivalent. 



11-04 F:

\<Group meeting>

- With a nice coincidence, I introduced Zixu to our group in the social session as he wanted to learn sequential modeling from us.
- \<Didn't do much on my own research>, need to push up tomorrow. 



11-03 R:

- Continue reading Liangming's references about information gain and try to make sense from them. 
- Sit in Xiachong and Taha's meeting and know what they are doing (and the state-of-the-art in their field).



11-02 W:

- Attend Yuxi's meeting w/ Min.
- Talked w/ Liangming. He is interested in my next work. He offers two points: (1) My ongoing topic is very promising w.r.t. his view. (2) A max info gain perspective ... leads to the next point👇 
- Read the papers from Goodman's group and William's group but haven't really understood. 



11-01 T:

- Read papers (discourse / machine learning / Min's 1998 verb paper)
- 2 hour research discussion with Jielin. She consulted me the training for a vision model for designers. I take analogy from different levels in NLP and advise her to try to stratify her problem. 
- Basketball 500kCal. 



## October

10-31 M:

- Finish discussion period for AAAI-23 review. 
- Update my webpage and initialize 2022 log starting today (many of them are offline, too lazy to move online).
