# Research overview {#research}

**One-sentence SOP:** I want to build computational models that understand human's language in an explainable and intelligent way. 

To achieve it, I am studying (have studied) the following topics:

## Discourse (2021-)

Discourse concerns the organization of text in a coherent and logical manner. It is a perfect discipline to study language understanding because diverse linguistic devices exist and complex reasoning is required. 

The problem is decomposed as:

- **Can we find a computational proxy for understanding discourse?** Despite the strong performance, pretrained language models (PLMs) are said to NOT understand the language [from text alone](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.463/). But can we say [certain understanding is achieved](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.143/) when the models [behave like human](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.8/)?
- **Intermediate guidance for better understanding?** PLMs are also pruned to adversarial input and spurious features. Can we guide the model with human's intelligence about decision-making [as intermediate input](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14465)?
- **Neurons for discourse functions?** Can we [causally estimate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262) [different components](http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/) in PLMs that are responsible for different discourse functions? 
- **Better pretraining strategy?** Popular PLMs (e.g. BERT) are trained in a [mask] way ([mask]=(simple, stupid, ...)). Are there better pretraining strategies to make it understand the language better?

Under submission. Please contact me if you're interested in reading it!



## Bridging emoji and lexical semantics (2021-) {#emoji}

Emojis inspire people to text creatively. People compose several emojis together to express a new meaning. For example:

üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è=üêª+üßä, where üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è is a composition of a bear üêª and ice üßä (means it is cold).

We have created a new dataset for concepts and their corresponding emoji compositions. We also have a model to learn such composition.

This is a FYP project by Zi Yun Yang that I co-advised with Prof Min. We tried to submit a paper to COLING '22, but it didn't make in. We are now revising the paper. Please contact us if you want to read our manuscript.



## Conversational recommendation (2018-2020) {#CRS}

Users have a hard time "telling" recommendation systems what they like. Recent advances in dialogue systems unlock new possibilities for user interactions. My [co-authored papers in 2020](#paper-2020) studied this topic. 

Even though I am not studying this topic currently, I wish the following aspects can be considered by our community:

- **Taxonomy creation**: Existing feature taxonomies are handcrafted. Is there a smart/soft way to build a taxonomy for better system design and evaluation?
- **Discourse structure:** Existing works (ours included) consider multi-round dialogue in a superficial manner. What features/products in previous rounds ***contrast\*** with those later? What information users heard in previous rounds ***caused\*** their later decision?
- **Real-world applications:** Many works (ours included) are developed and evaluated in the sandbox -- user simulation. How can we develop systems with (and for) real-world users (with diverse backgrounds, multiplex intent, and language variations)?

**Recommendation:** [Tutorials](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hexn/slides/sigir20-tutorial-CRS-slides.pdf) by Wenqiang et al. A pretty cool integrated [CRSLab](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CRSLab) environment by RUC. Talk to my group mate [Victor Li](https://lichuangnus.github.io/) who is currently studying this topic.
