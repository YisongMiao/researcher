# About

Aloha 👋 You have reached my academic homepage. 

I am a second year PhD student at [WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/)-[SoC](https://comp.nus.edu.sg/)-[NUS](https://nus.edu.sg/). I study natural language processing with [Prof Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy). 

Here is an [overview of my research](#research).



**Physical Yisong:** AS6 Building, meet me in the lab :P <br>**Digital Yisong:** [[Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a-oIKBoAAAAJ&hl=en)]  [[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yisongmiao/)]  [[GitHub](https://github.com/YisongMiao/)] [[Twitter](https://twitter.com/yisongmiao)]  [[Skype](live:miaoyisong)] <br>**Email Yisong:** [yisong domain-of comp.nus.edu.sg]; [miaoyisong domain-of gmail.com].<br>

I keep a progress log for my research:

# Research overview {#research}

I am now studying **reasonable natural language understanding** under Prof Min's guidance. [[Project Webpage @ WING-NUS](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/reasoning-nlp/)]<br>I approach it from two angles: <br>(1) 🔤 What reasoning evidence can we find in the language itself (e.g. semantics, structures)? <br>(2) 🌍 What reasoning evidence can we find in the language representation (characteristics of NN, world state implicated by NN)?  <br>

I am also fortunate to study with talented [lab mates](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/people/) at WING. I enjoy talking about research with them. <br>Notably, [Yuxi](https://yuxixie.github.io/) and [Taha](https://cuthalionn.github.io/) have a high overlap with my research. Their webpages can be interesting to you if you are interested in mine :P<br>

With Min's support, I am also advising following research:<br>-  🛒 I am providing high-level advice for [Saurabh Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabhsaurabh/) who studies [NLG for product comparison](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/comparison-of-products-in-conversational-systems/) for his MComp Thesis. This is a challenging task since semantics in products should be comprehended by the NLG component. Saurabh has past his defense 🎉 He is on job market. Please talk to him if you want to hire him. <br>-  🌉 I am working with [Yang Zi Yun](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/zi-yun-yang) on her BEng Thesis on bridging lexical composition with emoji mashup. This is the first time I start/advise a research project from scratch. Zi Yun has two [group](http://bit.ly/3BRZKcJ) [presentations](https://bit.ly/3wgdlsS) available on her [project webpage](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/bridging-emoji-mashup-and-lexical-composition/).

## Misc

I am TAing [CS4248](https://knmnyn.github.io/cs4248-2120/) (NLP) this semester. I am creating tutorial material. Talk to me if you have a small 💡idea/quiz/puzzle to share with us.

# Paper archive {#publication}

> If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough. -- Elon Musk, Tesla Motors

I use these contextual labels to organize my publications: (Here is a [Tutorial on how to make contextual labels](tut_cl) in Html and Jekyll)
- <span class="label label-blue">recommender system</span> 
- <span class="label label-yellow">conversational recommender system</span> 
- <span class="label label-orange">ML / RL (Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning)</span> 
- <span class="label label-green">knowledge graph</span>
- <span class="label label-purple">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>

I use 🌟 to intuitively show my devotion and contribution to the paper.<br>I also give a binary label, indicating whether it is a fast research or a slow research ([😛 wiki here](http://coling2018.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/180824-researchFastAndSlow-1.pdf) from Min's talk on this concept).

## Publications during my PhD

**Conference Papers**

To come.
