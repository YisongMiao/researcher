## Yisong Miao's Personal Website

<!-- Welcome to my personal website! -->

# About

Welcome! I hail from Xi'an, China, and did my undergraduate study in Beijing, China.<br>I'm an incoming PhD student at [SoC (School of Computing)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [NUS (National University of Singapore)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), starting Jan 2021. <br>
During my master study, I was affiliated to [WING (Web Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing Group)](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/). <br>
I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy) and [Dr. Wenqiang Lei](https://sites.google.com/view/wenqianghome/home). <br>
My office is on level 5 of AS6 building.  <br><br>
My <b>long-term goal</b> is to push the research boundary of interaction between AI and humanity (including history, literature, music and other forms of arts). To achieve this <b>long-term goal</b>, I not only conduct novel research as introduced in the next section, but also initiate [UCMW project](UCMW/index) purely out of my personal interest. I wish UCMW can come true in 2030. 

My CV is here: [PDF](Yisong-CV-2020-July.pdf).

I also have a note for *"Meta Research"*, recording the most fundamental methods (found by me / taught by my mentors) towards a good researcher: [Link to meta research](meta). I hope, at the end of the day, it would be the most valuable treasure.

Learning from my graduate study advisor Prof Min ([Link to his log](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/wiki/knmnynWiki14.html)), I also keep a [progress log](progress-log) for better time management. <br>**[Note on 30 Dec 2020]**, my progress log will be under one theme -- **Inter<sup>2</sup>** (<u>Inter</u>pretable and <u>Inter</u>active NLP/IR/AI). This is the scientific contribution I plan for my thesis (2023 planned). I have 3 years to reverse engineer this plan.

I have maintained a few reading list within my research interests: [Link to reading lists](readpapers)

**[Time donation for 1hr Zoom Session per week]** Feel free to directly talk to me, if you are a junior who wants advice for starting a career in AI. I am happy to help since I have received tremendous help from my seniors, despite this talk will not lead to a mentorship (I am not ready for that, [this link for why?](why-not-mentor)). Also see [this table](consultation-list) for my availability.

# Publications

> If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough. -- Elon Musk, Tesla Motors

I use these contextual labels to organize my publications: (Here is a [Tutorial on how to make contextual labels](tut_cl) in Html and Jekyll)
- <span class="label label-blue">recommender system</span> 
- <span class="label label-yellow">conversational recommender system</span> 
- <span class="label label-orange">ML / RL (Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning)</span> 
- <span class="label label-green">knowledge graph</span>
- <span class="label label-purple">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>

I use 🌟 to intuitively show my devotion and contribution to the paper.

I also give a binary label, indicating whether it is a fast research or a slow research ([😛 wiki here](http://coling2018.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/180824-researchFastAndSlow-1.pdf) from Min's talk on this concept).

- [Oct. 11th 2019] We have our first paper accepted by [WSDM 2020](http://wsdm-conference.org/2020/) on Conversational Recommendation! Acceptance rate is 15%. This is my first research experience, I am closely mentored by [Dr. Lei](https://sites.google.com/view/wenqianghome/home), [Dr. He](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hexn/), [Dr. Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) and [Dr. Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/).
- [May 16th 2020] I have one more paper co-authored with [Dr. Lei](https://sites.google.com/view/wenqianghome/home), [Dr. He](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hexn/), and Gangyi accepted to [KDD 2020](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/). This work is in line with our WSDM 2020 work on conversational recommendation. Thank you for all your support!
- [Dec 2nd 2020] <span style="color:red">New!</span> I have one more paper co-authored with [Dr. Lei](https://sites.google.com/view/wenqianghome/home) accepted to [AAAI 2021](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-21/). This work is a big milestone for me, it is my first NLP paper (previous works are more IR) and I contribute much more significantly than previous papers.

# Service

> Grow and help others grow. -- Anonymous

Dear mate, if you are a Program Chair or Area Chair visiting my site, I would be very happy to be a reviewer for conference in following areas: IR/NLP/DM with their methods using ML/RL/DL.

I always read the papers multiple times (2-3 times) and wait a few days (1-2 days) to write down a careful review. I also try my best to give authors constructional advice. Do not hesitate to email me if you want me to serve as a PC in your conference! (email: miaoyisong * AT * gmail dot com)

## Program Committee / Reviewer

- [Sometime 2019] NLPCC 2019, evaluated 2 research papers in NLP (dialogue track).
- [Oct 22nd 2020] Invited by NAACL 2021, in progress.
- [Dec 5th 2020] Invited by ACL-IJCNLP 2021, in progress.

## Secondary Reviewer

- AAAI 2021, evaluated 2 research papers in NLP (dialogue track + discourse track). 

  Disclosure: For the 2 papers, I reached a concensus with my mentod Dr. Lei and other reviewers on main quaility of the paper, despite I had further notes and advice. It might be an indicator that I am ready for top tier conferences review now.

- AAAI 2020, evaluated 1 research paper in NLP (dialogue track).
