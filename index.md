<!-- Welcome to my personal website! -->

# About

Welcome! I am Yisong. I am just a kid studying how to teach machines (if can) to understand natural language. <br>I am a first-year PhD student at [WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/)-[SoC](https://comp.nus.edu.sg/)-[NUS](https://nus.edu.sg/). I am fortunate to work with [Prof Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy). <br>Prior to that, I finished my master's study at the same place. Besides Min, I also have received guidance from other good researchers including Dr. Wenqiang Lei, Dr. Xiangnan He, and Dr. Tat-Seng Chua. We explored various topics about [conversational](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09102) [recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00194) and [semantics](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17560). I am always grateful for their support. <br>

My current research focuses on **reasonable natural language understanding**. I approach it from two angles: (1) what reasoning evidence can we find in the language itself (e.g. semantics, structures)? (2) what reasoning evidence can we find in the language representation (characteristics of NN, distributions of Prob)?  [[Project Webpage @ WING-NUS](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/reasoning-nlp/)]<br>

I am also fortunate to study with talented [lab mates](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/people/) at WING. I enjoy talking about research with them. <br>Notably, [Yuxi](https://yuxixie.github.io/) and [Taha](https://cuthalionn.github.io/) have a high overlap with my research. Their webpages can be interesting to you if you are interested in mine :P<br>With Min's support, I am also advising following research:<br>-  I am providing high-level advice for [Saurabh Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabhsaurabh/) who studies [NLG for product comparison](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/comparison-of-products-in-conversational-systems/) for his MComp Thesis. This is a challenging task since semantics in products should be comprehended by the NLG component. <br>-  I am working with [Yang Zi Yun](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/zi-yun-yang) on her BComp Thesis on bridging lexical composition with emoji mashup. This is the first time I start/advise a research project from scratch. Zi Yun has two [group](http://bit.ly/3BRZKcJ) [presentations](https://bit.ly/3wgdlsS) available on her [project webpage](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/bridging-emoji-mashup-and-lexical-composition/).

# Research Experiences

## My Research in Three Sentences

As a PhD student, I try to generate new knowledge for science and humanity.

I am summarizing my research highlights in three sentences. I wish this list can be updated often, with new highlights replacing old ones.

**July 2021 version:**

**Sent1:** Propose multi-round conversational recommendation, and co-design a solution for that.

**Sent2:** Identify not all antonym word pairs are still antonym in context, and co-create a corpus for that.

**Sent3:** *To Come*. *I focus on deep understanding and reasoning for NLP.*

I take the liberty of creating similar stuff for two cool guys, [Albert](albert) and [Steve](steve). Compared with them, my contributions to science and humanity seem quite incremental.

# Publications {#publication}

> If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough. -- Elon Musk, Tesla Motors

I use these contextual labels to organize my publications: (Here is a [Tutorial on how to make contextual labels](tut_cl) in Html and Jekyll)
- <span class="label label-blue">recommender system</span> 
- <span class="label label-yellow">conversational recommender system</span> 
- <span class="label label-orange">ML / RL (Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning)</span> 
- <span class="label label-green">knowledge graph</span>
- <span class="label label-purple">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>

I use 🌟 to intuitively show my devotion and contribution to the paper.<br>I also give a binary label, indicating whether it is a fast research or a slow research ([😛 wiki here](http://coling2018.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/180824-researchFastAndSlow-1.pdf) from Min's talk on this concept).

Junda has vast interest in machine learning and deep learning systems.  
- [Chaoren Li](http://chaoren-li.com) is a nice gentleman. He generously offered me his bedroom during my visit to the Bay Area in Spring 2020. He is now a software engineer leader at Google, solving major techinical problem with global impact! To be specific, he is the main designer for a key component for YouTube Apps. Please get in touch with Chaoren if you want to know more!
- [Dr. Zhen Wang, aka, 'zzzzzz'](http://joneswong.github.io/) is a gentleman I know in the Running Group.
