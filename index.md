<!-- Welcome to my personal website! -->

# About

Welcome! I hail from Xi'an, China, and did my undergraduate study in Beijing, China.<br>I'm now a second-year master student at [SoC (School of Computing)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), [NUS (National University of Singapore)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). <br>
I'm affiliated to [WING (Web Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing Group)](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/). <br>
I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy) and [Dr. Wenqiang Lei](https://sites.google.com/view/wenqianghome/home). <br>
My office is on level 5 of AS6 building. <br><br>
My <b>long-term goal</b> is to push the research boundary of interaction between AI and humanity (including history, literature, music and other forms of arts), and answer a basic question: how we human perceive beauty. To achieve this <b>long-term goal</b>, I not only conduct novel research as introduced in the next section, but also initiate [UCMW project](UCMW/index) purely out of my personal interest.



My CV is here: [PDF](Yisong-cv-2020may-officialpubs.pdf)

I also have a note for *"Meta Research"*, recording the most fundamental methods (found by me / taught by my mentors) towards a good researcher: [Link to meta research](meta). I hope, at the end of the day, it would be the most valuable treasure.

Learning from my graduate study advisor Prof Min ([Link to his log](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/wiki/knmnynWiki14.html)), I also keep a [progress log](progress-log) for better time management.

I have maintained a few reading list within my research interests: [Link to reading lists](readpapers)

- [Oct. 11th 2019] We have our first paper accepted by [WSDM 2020](http://wsdm-conference.org/2020/) on Conversational Recommendation! Acceptance rate is 15%. This is my first research experience, I am closely mentored by [Dr. Lei](https://sites.google.com/view/wenqianghome/home), [Dr. He](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hexn/), [Dr. Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) and [Dr. Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/).
- [May 16th 2020] <span style="color:red">New!</span> I have one more paper co-authored with [Dr. Lei](https://sites.google.com/view/wenqianghome/home), [Dr. He](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hexn/), and Gangyi accepted to [KDD 2020](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/). This work is in line with our WSDM 2020 work on conversational recommendation. Thank you for all your support!

# URL Links to my friends who're not my research collaborators

> *When Voldemort is after you, you'd better be with your friends*. -- What Yisong learns from Harry Potter

My friends, the following order is based on the time I found your URL, i.e. in a <u>"first-come-first-record"</u> fashion. Please tell me if you'd like to be presented and introduced here! <span style="color:red">Emprically it is a great way to increase your PageRank on [Google](www.google.com).</span> (e.g., [this search result](https://www.google.com/search?q=xin+wang+prosperity+investment&oq=xin+wang+&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j35i39l2j0l3j69i65l2.2764j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)) However, it is still an open question that whether it is ME increase YOUR PageRank, or the inverse way :p.
