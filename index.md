# About

Aloha üëã You have reached my academic homepage. 

I am a second year PhD student at [WING](https://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/)-[SoC](https://comp.nus.edu.sg/)-[NUS](https://nus.edu.sg/). I study natural language processing with [Prof Min-Yen Kan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy). 

Here is an [overview of my research](#research).

# Research overview {#research}

I am working (have worked) on these research topics. 



## Discourse (2021-)

We are currently submitting. 



## Bridging emoji and lexical semantics (2021-)

We tried to submit a paper to COLING '22, but it didn't make in. Please contact me if you would like to read our manuscript. 



## Conversational recommendation (2018-2020)

Users have a hard time to "tell" traditional recommendation system what they like. Recent advances in dialogue/interactive systems unlock new

Dear mate, if you are a Program Chair or Area Chair visiting my site, I would be very happy to be a reviewer for conference in following areas: IR/NLP/DM with their methods using ML/RL/DL.

I always read the papers multiple times (2-3 times) and wait a few days (1-2 days) to write down a careful review. I also try my best to give authors constructional advice. Do not hesitate to email me if you want me to serve as a PC in your conference! (email: miaoyisong * AT * gmail dot com)
