Dear mates:
I am not open to publicly recruiting juniors to be mentored by me. This is because I am a junior myself. For the best result, I will be happy to publicly recruit mentees when I am more senior.

So far, I only take mentees who are assigned by my own mentors (Prof. Min and Dr. Lei). In this case, the mentees can at least receive additional help from them.
Nevertheless, I am happy to donate 1 hour per week for a zoom session to the general research consultation.

Cheers,
Yisong
