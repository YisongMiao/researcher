## Progress log for the week of May 25th -- May 31st

## Travel to Beijing

- Travel to Beijing with Xin. (May 25, G26 Train)

- Take Xin to meet friends, including Zek, Hengyang, Hongwei at 3 different dinners.

  - ### With Zek:

    - Dinner at 红辣椒；Dinner at 鸿宾楼；Drinking at Amid Bar.  
    - We shared our experiences with Chaoren, who hosted my stay at Bay Area. 
    - He gave advice on my relationship with Xin. 
    - He told me that, he can understand my worry that my girlfriend might have solo activity with other male in professional scenario. He told me Xin is a nice girl, she has her moral code, so I shouldn't worry for that.
    - He told me, "massive success is the best revenge". I should not think about taking revenge on any single male who might harrass Xin, instead I should consider buying her company after ten years and appointing those male as my personal assistants. 
    - He told me, being self-dissatisfied is normal. Just fix your problem, but don't hurt others. 
    - "Take a leap of faith". Let's say there is a cliff, if you believe you can jump through it, then you really can. 
    - At the same dinner, I had a couple of drinks with Mr. Dong Chen, who was Zek's boss at Dangdang and is now a business manager at JD. Mr. Chen is also a very nice gentleman. He read my techinical report on an AI area last year, and said it was impressive. Mr. Chen is worth long-term friendship with me. 

  - ### With Hengyang:

    - Dinner at 鸿宾楼
    - We memorised our time at Senz (2015) where he was the CTO and mentored my first internship. (actually this internship pushed me to switched from Physics department to CS department)
    - There is a **balance** between technology and business. 
    - Hengyang is now in a "verticle route" (垂直赛道) of intelligent construction and devoted himself in project management and BD. He will soon become a multi-millionaire after his company goes to IPO. Before he graduated from his PhD at BUPT, he believed technology is everything. In 2016, he is among the most knowledgeable person in China in the area of Neural Networks.  Now, he can sense the balance between tech and business. 

  - ### With Hongwei:

    - Dinner at 懒人餐厅
    - He speaks highly of Xin's first successful inverstment case from his perspective as a senior partner 🎉
    - He commented on the intrinsic logic of career choosing and position changing: Xin is young and can make the change from back-desk to front-desk.
    - He advised Xin that, the core competitiveness of a front-desk is networking and resource exchangement. However, Xin is intrinsically not interested in networking. She has to overcome this weakness. Otherwise, she can also consider doing law after 5-6 years (which is also very good). 
    - He commented that, Yisong is extremely (like among top 5% of people he knows) good at networking, he wonder why I insisted doing research (which is highly solo activity). I explained that, doing research can help me develop the most needy ability for me, i.e. independence, determination, etc. 
    - He commented that, the world is highly dynamic, I should have a dynamic and open mind. I shouldn't refuse opportunities. (he is skeptical for my declining ByteDance's engineering position, but let's go back to the 4th point...)
    - He commented that, the job market is a market. The boss what use $10 to hire someone with $12 ability, however, if you have $12 ability, you should go for $15 jobs. 



## Self

- Change my hairstyle with hairstylist Ziyi. (wechat Added). He advised me that I should try 发泥 to make me sharper!
- My weight slightly grow by 1kg - 2kg. 😋



## Research

Since I'm busy travelling this week, I didn't make much progress in research this week, but I still have a few to note:



- I helped Wenqiang revised their EMNLP paper. He speaks highly of my revision suggestions.
- Me and Wenqiang are considering applying for new fundings to support my research!
- ALMOST ready for recommendation letter for PhD applications. 



- I studied the IJCAI paper on discourse, I'm very curious to find out WHAT boosts the performance? The improvement is brought by the RoBERTa? 
- I SCANNED a few new papers on ACL 2020, more details to come next week.
- Wenqiang gave feedback on our TACL submission, he criticized on me that I didn't figure out the CORE of this paper. He wish me to be more brave, to try to define a problem and find evidence to support that. 



## News / Books / Articles this week

- Started reading the series of book by Dr. Jun Wu (吴军), 见识, 态度, Xin is also reading it!



- US has a strict restriction on Chinese grad students...
- SpaceX has the first successful man craft launch!! 🎉
  - I am a big fan of Elon, I admire his entrepreneurship and engineering. However, I'd love to see more fundamental scientific breakthrough (c.f. Three Body 三体 末日之战)
