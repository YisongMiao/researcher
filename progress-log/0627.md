## Monday-Thursday

Revising and submiting my master thesis

[x] Done



## Friday

Start doing my research.



First, headup to my teammates.

[x]Teammate meeting

   [x]Yufeng

   [x]Runpeng

[x]Read Samson’s paper

Slides can be found at: [https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/talks/Its%20Morphin%20Time%20Combating%20Linguistic%20Discrimination%20with%20Inflectional%20Perturbations.pdf](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/talks/Its Morphin Time Combating Linguistic Discrimination with Inflectional Perturbations.pdf)

To summary, this paper discovers that morphological inflection is a discrimination!

- Many models cannot perform well given those morphological inflections — **discover that it is a flaw for many state-of-the-art models**.
- Fine-tuning existing models can better the performance.
- - I think it is a plus, because it provides solutions.

[]Submit our KDD work to ArXiv

   []We get a format error to fix first.

[] **Short term:** Intro Done for our AAAI submission

[]Ask Yunshan for the [teamup.com](http://teamup.com/) usage of DGX GPUs.

[x]Found a very stable way to connect to DGX servers.

[x]Installed conda and torch.

[] **Long-term**: Study shortcuts in terminals… How to directly login to a server, How to open my website git repo, etc… 

Reading Chris Manning’s paper

- Can we have a definition on self supervision?
- - Self-supervised learning allows us to learn good representations without using large **annotated** databases. Instead, we can use unlabeled data (which is abundant) and optimize pre-defined *pretext* tasks. We can then use these features to learn new tasks in which data is scarce.
