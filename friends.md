- [Qingfeng Lan](https://lancelqf.github.io/) is a good friend of mine. I was lucky to be his dorm mate in [UCAS](https://english.cas.cn/) in AY 2015/16. Enjoying his books (e.g. [Gödel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach)) and music (e.g. [Li Chen 陈粒](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E9%99%B3%E7%B2%92)) in evenings is one of the best college moments for me! He is a nice person and always helps others. He is the inaugural Editor-in-chief for an advice book (50+ articles, one of them authored by me :P) on how to apply for grad school, bringing significant help for alumni of UCAS (a new school). He is now a PhD student at [U of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), focusing on RL research.
