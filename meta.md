## Meta Research

I'm Yisong, a junior researcher. Most of my professional time is spent on (1) finding a problem; (2) solving a problem. However, what if we consider *research* as essentially a research problem? I have distilled following research questions for it:

- How to discover impactful research ideas?
- How to formulate a phenomenon into a researchable task?
- What experiment should we do in order to support our claim?
- How to do meaninful discussions to inspire further study?

I define this topic as *"Meta Research"*.



In this note, I will record my jounrey towards *"Meta Research*". 

It is constituted of my conversations with my mentors/friends (therefore some posts are in Chinese), my independent thoughts, etc. 

I hope, at the end of the day, this note will demonstrate each small step towards my success.

As usual, I have a pointer as the start: [Dr. Shannon's talk on Creative Thinking.](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~naderi/Claude%20Shannon.html):

- The first one is obvious - training and experience.
- The second thing is a certain amount of intelligence or talent.
- For want of a better word, we will call it motivation.
- **The first one that I might speak of is the idea of simplification.**
- **A very similar device is seeking similar known problems.**
- **Another approach for a given problem is to try to restate it in just as many different forms as you can.**
- **Another mental gimmick for aid in research work, I think, is the idea of generalization.**
- **Next one I might mention is the idea of structural analysis of a problem.**
- **Now one other thing I would like to bring out which I run across quite frequently in mathematical work is the idea of inversion of the problem.**
